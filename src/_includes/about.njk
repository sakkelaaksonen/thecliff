                    I am a Beninese Grand-popo visual artist, based in Helsinki, Finland.
                    The material (Calabashes gourds) I use is a natural fruit that grows in Africa, Benin, Togo and
                    Ghana
                    and elsewhere...
                </p>
                <p class="text-xl mt-6 text-white leading-relaxed">
                    I use it to make different lamps and motifs to connect with nature and people.
                    Calabashes are large dried fruits that can be used as containers or various objects in Vodou
                    traditions, and music and stage art.
                </p>

                    They are produced by plants which are divided into two families.
                    Cucurbitae represented mainly by the species Lagenaria Siceraria.
                    The other family is the Arecaceae family, represented by the species Hyphaene thebaica.
